# The server (i.e. the Python app) waits on a TCP port provided. Whenever
# anything connects to that port, it immediately sends a legacyRemoteConnected
# event that includes the protocol name and version.

# It then waits for the client to send requests, the first of which will be
# legacyRemoteDebuggerAuthenticate, which includes the protocol name and version,
# and the string secret which can be an empty string to designate the lack of a
# specified secret.
#
# If the secret does not match the one expected by the server, it responds
# accepted=False, and then closes the connection. Otherwise, the server responds
# accepted=True, and continues waiting for requests.
#
# If the client does not send a legacyRemoteDebuggerAuthenticate request, then
# any other request will fail and the connection will be closed.
#
# The following commands are recognized:
#
# 'legacyRemoteDebuggerInfo'
#   Report information about the process. The server responds with the following:
#       - Process ID
#       - Executable name
#       - User name
#       - Implementation name
#   and then immediately closes connection. Note, all string fields can be
#   empty or null strings.
#
# 'legacyRemoteDebuggerAttach'
#   Attach debugger to the process. If successful, the server responds with
#   accepted=True, along with process ID, and the Python language version that
#   the server is running represented by three integers - major, minor, micro.
#   From there on the socket is assumed to be using the normal PTVS debugging protocol.
#   If attaching was not successful (which can happen if some other debugger is
#   already attached), the server responds with accepted=False and closes the connection. 
#
# 'legacyRemoteReplAttach'
#   Attach REPL to the process. If successful, the server responds with
#   accepted=True, and from there on the socket is assumed to be using the
#   normal PTVS REPL (binary) protocol. If not successful (which can happen if
#   there is no debugger attached), the server responds with accepted=False and
#   closes the connection.

    Parameters
    ----------
    secret : str
        Used to validate the clients - only those clients providing the valid
        secret will be allowed to connect to this server. On client side, the
        secret is prepended to the Qualifier string, separated from the
        hostname by ``'@'``, e.g.: ``'secret@myhost.cloudapp.net:5678'``. If
        secret is ``None``, there's no validation, and any client can connect
        freely.
    address : (str, int), optional 
        Specifies the interface and port on which the debugging server should
        listen for TCP connections. It is in the same format as used for
        regular sockets of the `socket.AF_INET` family, i.e. a tuple of
        ``(hostname, port)``. On client side, the server is identified by the
        Qualifier string in the usual ``'hostname:port'`` format, e.g.:
        ``'myhost.cloudapp.net:5678'``. Default is ``('0.0.0.0', 5678)``.
    certfile : str, optional
        Used to enable SSL. If not specified, or if set to ``None``, the
        connection between this program and the debugger will be unsecure,
        and can be intercepted on the wire. If specified, the meaning of this
        parameter is the same as for `ssl.wrap_socket`. 
    keyfile : str, optional
        Used together with `certfile` when SSL is enabled. Its meaning is the
        same as for ``ssl.wrap_socket``.
    redirect_output : bool, optional
        Specifies whether any output (on both `stdout` and `stderr`) produced
        by this program should be sent to the debugger. Default is ``True``.

    Notes
    -----
    This function returns immediately after setting up the debugging server,
    and does not block program execution. If you need to block until debugger
    is attached, call `ptvsd.wait_for_attach`. The debugger can be detached
    and re-attached multiple times after `enable_attach` is called.

    This function can only be called once during the lifetime of the process. 
    On a second call, `AttachAlreadyEnabledError` is raised. In circumstances
    where the caller does not control how many times the function will be
    called (e.g. when a script with a single call is run more than once by
    a hosting app or framework), the call should be wrapped in ``try..except``.

    Only the thread on which this function is called, and any threads that are
    created after it returns, will be visible in the debugger once it is
    attached. Any threads that are already running before this function is
    called will not be visible.
